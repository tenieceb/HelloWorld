# Overview

I used this HelloWorld program to learn how to set up a C# file and folder structure. As a software engineering student, I find it helpful to learn through hands-on scenarios. To support that, Iâ€™ve begun creating my own simple programs to strengthen my practical understanding of concepts.

This program outputs the text "Hello World!" to the console.

The purpose of this project is to fully understand the fundamentals of setting up and running a C# console application using the .NET framework and Visual Studio Code.
